# Migration

Document any changes that need to be made by module instances using these modules to uptake
a newer version. For example, if a new required variable is added, this should be documented here.

### Unreleased

- If using the optional `cirrus_inputs.lambda_version` or `cirrus_inputs.lambda_zip_filepath` to denote a specific
  version of Cirrus, you must additionally define a `cirrus_inputs.lambda_pyversion`. Cirrus geo versions are now
  tied to specific Python runtime versions; see the
  [cirrus-geo releases](https://github.com/cirrus-geo/cirrus-geo/releases) for details.

- Removes support for VPC creation. To retain the existing VPC resources, manually
  remove them from the Terraform state file. However, you should then create another
  IaC deployment for that VPC.
- `stac_server_inputs` and `titiler_inputs`, renamed
  `stac_server_and_titiler_s3_arns` to `authorized_s3_arns`.
- `titiler_inputs.mosaic_titiler_release_tag` is now `titiler_inputs.version`
- `cirrus_dashboard_inputs.cirrus_dashboard_release` is now `cirrus_dashboard_inputs.version`
- `console_ui_inputs.filmdrop_ui_release` is now `console_ui_inputs.version`
- `deploy_sample_data_bucket` option has been removed

### 2.55.0

- Terraform version >= 1.13.0 is now required

### 2.x

- There were certainly many, but they were not documented.

### 1.7.0

- Remove cirrus_dashboard_release_tag uses in deployment to use new default version of v0.5.1
- Please upgrade to AWS provider `~=5.20`

### 1.6.0

- The jupyterhub-dask-eks module no longer takes a parameter `kubernetes_cluster_name`,
  but now requires a parameter `environment`. Resource names that previously used
  `kubernetes_cluster_name` now construct those using the `project_name` and `environment`
  variables
- The default OpenSearch cluster name has changed to include both
  environment/stage, to allow for multiple deployments to a single AWS account.
  Unfortunately, an OpenSearch cluster name can't be changed after creation, so
  running a TF apply would attempt to destroy the old cluster and create a new
  one. If it is desired to preserve the old cluster (and data) upon taking this
  update, a new optional variable has been added to override the cluster name.
  Setting the input variable `opensearch_stac_server_domain_name_override` to
  match the pre-existing cluster name will allow taking this update to preserve
  the old default name moving forward.

### 1.5.0

- console-ui.filmdrop_ui_release must be gte 4.x, e.g., `v4.0.1`. Along with this,
  the `filmdrop_ui_env` variable should be removed, the .env files deleted, and the
  `VITE_APP_NAME` variable moved to `APP_NAME` in the config json file.

### 1.4.x

- Please upgrade to AWS provider `~=5.13`
- The WAF rules for mosaic titiler have been defined in the mosaic-titler module.  The consumer
  must now pass in an "aws.east" provider because cloudfront requires global resources created in
  us-east-1.  Consumers should set the new "waf_allowed_url" variable to set the WAF rules to enable
  blocking of requests.  Leaving the default of null will set the rules to count only and disable
  blocking.  If the consumer has previous defined a mosaic titiler WAF rule using the "titiler_waf_rules_map"
  variable, this should be removed as it has been replaced with the module's implementation.
- Remove the OpenSearch service linked role from the terraform state with `terraform state rm 'aws_iam_service_linked_role.opensearch_linked_role'`

### 1.3.0

- If your deployment does not use cloudfront in front of stac-server, the stac_api_rootpath variable
  in stac-server/inputs.tf must be set to null.  The default (empty string) is correct for when
  cloudfront is in use.

### 1.2.0

- FilmDrop UI version >= 3.0.0 is now required. Previously, the configuration file was a
  JavaScript file and was placed in `./src/assets/config.js`. It is now a JSON file and is
  placed in `./public/config/config.json`. This change can be seen in
  [this commit](https://github.com/Element84/filmdrop-ui/pull/202/files#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).
  The primary changes are:
  * The JavaScript const variables are now JSON attribute names.
  * Parameters (JSON attribute names) are no longer prevised by `VITE_`, e.g.,
    `VITE_DEFAULT_COLLECTION` is now `DEFAULT_COLLECTION`
  * Parameters for which you wish to use the default no longer need to be included as null/empty.
